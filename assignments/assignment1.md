# Assignment 1 - Collocation tool

In the previous lesson, we saw that words which frequently co-occur together in a given context are known as collocates. We also saw that we could calculate the strength of association between collocates, allowing us to see how much two words are related to one another. This is important because of the distributional hypothesis - that you can learn a lot about what a word means based on the other words that appear around it.

For this assignment, you will write a small Python program to perform collocational analysis using the string processing and NLP tools you've already encountered. Your script should do the following:

- Take a user-defined search term and a user-defined window size.
- Take one specific text which the user can define.
- Find all the context words which appear Â± the window size from the search term in that text.
- Calculate the mutual information score for each context word.
- Save the results as a CSV file with (at least) the following columns: the collocate term; how often it appears as a collocate; how often it appears in the text; the mutual information score.
  
For this assignment, you should create a private Github repository and add me as a collaborator. When submitting via Brightspace, simply send the link to the repository; I will provide feedback and comments via Github's built in functionality.

## Tips and pointers

- You are welcome to work on this and submit as a group, even though it says Individual Assignment.
- Try to provide a README file which outlines the contents of the repository.
- For your dataset, you should use the novels in the shared data folder, under 100 English Novels. You should not include the data in your Github repo - an empty folder called data is fine!
- Calculate mutual information using either the score we looked at in class or the formula outlined on the website for the British National Corpus. The latter approach here is a little easier, I think, and totally acceptable to use.
- Be sure to pay attention to tokenization, capital letters, punctuation, etc. All of these could affect your final scores!

## Bonus tasks
- Create a program which does the above for every novel in the corpus, saving one output CSV per novel
- Create a program which does this for the whole dataset, creating a CSV with one set of results, showing the mutual information scores for collocates across the whole set of texts
- Create a program which allows a user to define a number of different collocates at the same time, rather than only one

## Goals and outcomes

- The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that you have a good understanding of how to use simple text processing techniques to extract valuable information from text data
- Essentially we are attemping to replicate the kind of functionality available in the online web interfaces that we saw last week but on a dataset of our choosing
- After completing this assignment, you will have a simple collocation tool which can in principal be resused on another text dataset of your choice
